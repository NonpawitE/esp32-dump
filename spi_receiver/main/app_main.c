/*
SPI receiver (slave) example.

This example is supposed to work together with the SPI sender. It uses the standard SPI pins (MISO, MOSI, SCLK, CS) to
transmit data over in a full-duplex fashion, that is, while the master puts data on the MOSI pin, the slave puts its own
data on the MISO pin.

This example uses one extra pin: GPIO_HANDSHAKE is used as a handshake pin. After a transmission has been set up and we're
ready to send/receive data, this code uses a callback to set the handshake pin high. The sender will detect this and start
sending a transaction. As soon as the transaction is done, the line gets set low again.
